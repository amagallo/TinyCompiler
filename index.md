# Tiny Compiler & P-Code Virtual Machine

Welcome! 👋  
This site presents the final project for the *Language Processors* course:  
a full **compiler toolchain** for the **Tiny** procedural language, together with a custom **stack-based P-code virtual machine**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Complete compilation pipeline: lexical analysis, parsing, binding, typing, memory assignment, and code generation.  
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) modeled in Java 17 with records and interfaces.  
- Reflection-based dispatcher with memoization for efficient processing.  
- Robust code generation for structured control flow, types, and procedures.  
- Custom P-code virtual machine with dynamic memory management and exception handling.
