# Tiny Compiler & P-Code Virtual Machine

**Welcome!** 👋  
This site presents a full **compiler toolchain** for **Tiny**, a procedural programming language, along with the **code generation tools** for a custom stack-based **P-code virtual machine**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Complete **compilation pipeline**: lexical analysis, parsing, binding, typing, memory assignment, and code generation.  
- **Abstract Syntax Tree** (AST) modeled in Java 17 with records and interfaces.  
- Reflection-based **dispatcher** with memoization for efficient processing.  
- Robust **code generation** for structured control flow, types, and procedures.  
- Custom **P-code virtual machine** with dynamic memory management and exception handling.
